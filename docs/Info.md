# **Automated Minecraft Server Setup**

## **Overview**
A set of scripts to **instantly set up a Minecraft server** based on your preferences.  
It automates everything: choosing server type, installing mods/plugins, and optionally adding Bedrock support with Geyser/Floodgate.

---

## **Features**
- **Automatic server setup:** PaperMC or Fabric, ready to run.  
- **Optional Bedrock support:** Geyser/Floodgate integration works seamlessly.  
- **CPU-aware Playit installation:** Automatically downloads the correct binary for your system.  
- **Minimal user input:** Scripts do almost all the work.  
- **Organized structure:** All folders, mods, and plugins in the right place.  

---

## **Server Types**
- **PaperMC:** Optimized Spigot fork for plugins and performance. Great for bigger or plugin-heavy servers.  
- **Fabric:** Lightweight mod loader for mods. Less overhead, very mod-friendly.
